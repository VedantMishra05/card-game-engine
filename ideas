alice in boderland game .. pick joker card game ..
war, black jack, poker, trick-taking rules, custom ranking system

🔁 Event-driven game flow
🎮 Real player decisions
🧠 AI players
🌐 Multiplayer architecture
🧩 Adding a second card game cleanly
🖥️ UI integration strategy
Introduce a Round object (stores playedCards + winners)
Event system (RoundStarted, CardPlayed, RoundEnded)
HumanPlayer vs AIPlayer abstraction
Second game mode (e.g. War) to validate architecture
Unit tests for rules (very valuable)


What you unlocked (this is huge)
With this design, you can now
🎨 UI Animations
Pause after CardPlayedEvent
Animate card movement
Resume game
🌐 Multiplayer
Broadcast events over network
Sync remote clients
🎥 Replays
Record events
Replay them later
🧪 Testing
Assert events instead of console output
🤖 AI
AI listens to events and reacts


Dynamic registration (very advanced)
Later, you could even:
Scan the rule package
Automatically register all RoundRule implementations
Populate a menu dynamically
No need to modify App at all when adding new rules.


generics madness
inheritance trees
event systems yet


What I recommend next (best order)
Extract a Round object
Add delay support (async events)
Add HumanPlayer input via events
Add second game mode to stress test events
If you want, next I can:
Refactor your Game fully to event-only
Add async delay handling (without threads mess)
Design player input as events

I want to understand the flow of the program, like when game starts what part part of code plays what role, what it calls and how it affects the outcome ( a dry run or debugging of the project flow if you will )
